          <p>Families, children, people, and civilians, in general, all get affected by their countries' choices when it comes to solving problems or making relationships with other countries, some countries solve the problem easily with a new rule or by a simple peace treatment which doesn’t affect its people that much, others solve it by the worst way ever this is by violence, by declaring war with other countries, by killing millions of lives in the name of peace which leads to the opposite, innocent civilians lose their life, families, friends, their dreams all because the answer they reached is violence.<br><br>
              Stories of millions of Palestinians from before the 7th of October and after the 7th of October were told to the world seeking some kind of humanity but leaders, and countries only cared about how all of this would affect their economy and their money, they didn’t care about how above millions of innocent children become orphans, and millions of women become widows, and millions of men cry for the lost of his parents, wives, children, and how no one cry’s over the loss of a family because no one in this family was left, all of them died and the only thing left is their stories, stories that are well known and will be passed on from generation to generation, here are some of the most famous stories

                His hair is curly and white, and he is sweet.” These were the cries of a grieving Palestinian mother, calling out loudly the specifications of her child, as she searched for him in a hospital in Gaza.The video clip of this mother spread widely on social networking sites, as she was burning with fear searching for her child...distracted, perhaps she would meet the delight of her missing liver.
                <br><br>She would ask everyone she encountered about a child with these beautiful characteristics, repeating: “His hair is curly, sweet, white.” Perhaps someone had seen him, as he was distinguished by these characteristics and easy to recognize. Youssef is a seven-year-old child. <br>

                    His body arrived at the hospital as a martyr in a barbaric Israeli bombing that did not differentiate between children and adults. He arrived at the same hospital where his father works as a doctor, but the father, who was busy treating the wounded and following up on the martyrs, did not know that he would see his liver as a martyr in the hospital. Same for the last time.. Difficult moments passed and he received the news that the shocked doctor did not want to receive.. Youssef is here somewhere, and he must take one last look to make sure that he is the “white one with curly hair”.. The father’s steps remained in place.<br><br>
                In April 1948, the Zionists took control of the city of Haifa, one of the largest Palestinian cities, and their next target was the city of Jaffa.
                 On the same day that the British Mandate forces officially withdrew from Palestine, David Ben-Gurion, head of the Zionist Agency, announced the establishment of the State of Israel. The United Nations appointed Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte as its mediator in Palestine. Bernadotte recognized the tragedy of the Palestinian people and tried to find a solution to end their suffering caused by the Zionists. His tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution to stop the ongoing Zionist ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Palestinians ended when the Zionists assassinated him in September 1948. The Nakba symbolizes the 1948 mass forced displacement of more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and lands in Palestine.
        <br><br>Moments passed without He could take a step forward so as not to see what he did not desire.. He wanted to see him as he was accustomed to, to meet him at home, beautiful and full of life, to embrace him, but the last look confirmed that this martyred child was Joseph himself... while the mother could not control herself and collapsed in shock, screaming. “Oh heartache.” Her beautiful child, Youssef, “the white one with curly hair,” became an angel martyr. This is one of the many stories of the loss of innocent children.

            <P>
                Ismail, Zakaria, Ahed, and Mohamed are four names that are seemingly random and have no particular significance for the average person in the world.  
        
        However, these four names are well known and engraved into every Palestinian’s consciousness. 
        They are the Bakr family children – each of them between nine and eleven years old. I don’t blame you for not recognising their names.
        The truth is – Palestinian names, families, and faces are not remembered in a world where public opinion and awareness is dictated by a 24/7 news cycle.
        <br>
            </P>

                Their story wasn’t spread. Their loss wasn’t humanised and interviews with their loved ones weren’t conducted. So no one learned of their joys, their dreams, or their aspirations.
                
                A year ago, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy, Mohammed Abu Khdeir, was burned alive by Israeli attackers in Jerusalem in a “price tag” revenge killing.Moments passed without He could take a step forward so as not to see what he did not desire.. He wanted to see him as he was accustomed to, to meet him at home, beautiful and full of life, to embrace him, but the last look confirmed that this martyred child was Joseph himself... while the mother could not control herself and collapsed in shock, screaming. “Oh heartache.” Her beautiful child, Youssef, “the white one with curly hair,” became an angel martyr. This is one of the many stories of the loss of innocent children. 
                <br><br>
                Last Friday, the burning of an 18-month-old toddler, Ali Saad Dawabsheh, in an arson attack by settlers on the family home in the Duma village, marked the one year anniversary of Abu Khdeir’s death.
                
                The truth is we don’t mourn the loss of Palestinian lives. We don’t pause to remember the families who were wiped out, the homes and schools methodically blown up, the hospitals and ambulances surgically targeted, or the countless innocent individuals murdered while simply trying to live their lives.
                
                The killing of Cecil the Lion had far more global coverage and calls for investigations than the Bakr children, Abu Khdeir, and the 18-month-old Ali.
                <br><br>
                How do we excuse Israel’s holding of 6,000 Palestinian political prisoners – some as young as 11 years old – and one out of four elected Palestinian parliament members being locked up?
                
                How do we explain the disproportional response of diplomats flocking into Gaza seeking the release of one Israeli soldier captured in the aftermath of Israel’s summer assault on the Strip?
                
                Where are the delegations seeking the release of 1.4 million Palestinians from Israel’s open-air “concentration camp-like” Gaza Strip?

                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

                    <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
