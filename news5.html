          <p>There have been 439 Palestinians from the university community killed and 11 higher education buildings completely or partially damaged since the start of the Israel-Palestine war on 7 October, according to the Palestinian government. Higher education has been severely disrupted.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MHESR) posted a “<b>Summary of violations against Palestinians in the higher education sector</b>” to its Facebook page on Monday 6 November.
            <br>
            <br>
            The ministry stressed that the figures were “subject to frequent changes and updates” because of ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and Jerusalem.
            <br><br>
            The 439 people killed include 427 students and 12 academics or employees, 85% of them in the Gaza Strip. Nine of the 11 higher education buildings damaged are in Gaza and two in the West Bank.
            <br><br>
            “The entire educational process was disrupted in 19 higher education institutions in the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said, which has led to 88,000 students being deprived of education. Face-to-face education has been disrupted in all 34 higher education institutions in the West Bank, affecting 138,800 students.
            <br><br>
            Further, 555 students from the Gaza Strip were unable to enrol in scholarships abroad.
            <br><br>
            “There are hundreds of detainees and prisoners in the West Bank and thousands wounded in the Gaza Strip from the higher education sector whose numbers cannot be monitored or counted due to field conditions,” reads the statement. The government said the true numbers are “probably much higher”.
            <br><br>
            In the Gaza Strip, scientists were struggling to find safe havens from ongoing attacks by Israel, which declared war on Hamas on 8 October. Professor Marwan Awartani, president of the Palestine Academy for Science and Technology, based in the West Bank, told Science: “The priority isn’t science – the priority is staying alive.”

            <br>
        <p>In another presentation, MHESR indicated that the higher education buildings that were completely or partially damaged included the <b>Islamic University of Gaza, Al-Azhar University, the North Gaza and Tubas branches of Al-Quds Open University</b>, and buildings of An-Najah National University located at Palestine Technical University Kadoorie. In some cases, “entire buildings were demolished”.
        <br><br>
        On 7 November, Birzeit University in the West Bank issued a statement saying that Israeli forces had stormed and vandalised the university and confiscated flags and belongings in student residences. “The university denounces this new attack,” it said.
        <br><br>
        MHESR argues that “the Israeli occupation targeting educational buildings in Palestine through bombing, damage or incursions and tampering with their contents”, constitutes a violation of the <b>Fourth Geneva Convention</b> of 1949, relating to the protection of civilians in time of war.
        <br><br>
        In Gaza, during Israel’s retaliation, the death toll has now passed 10,000 with more than 20,000 people injured, according to the <b>Palestinian health ministry</b>.
        <br><br>
        There is a long history of attacks on Palestinian schools, universities, students and staff, recorded by various organisations such as Education Under Attack, during the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. Describing attacks against Palestine education, Trace – the <b>Track Attacks on Education Data Portal</b>, based on data provided by the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack, reported:
        <br><br>
        “Over 420 attacks on, or interferences to education, occurred in Palestine in 2020-2021. Attacks peaked in May 2021, when bombardments affected over 290 kindergartens, schools, and higher education facilities in Gaza. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, demolition or stop-work orders, teargas or other weapons firing at or near schools, military presence near schools, and checkpoint delays affected thousands of students and educators.”

<p>
    Several Palestinian universities have issued a statement accusing Israeli universities of being used for military purposes and called upon the international academic community to boycott the country.
<br><br>
The Palestine Academy for Science and Technology called for a boycott of Israeli higher education by the international academic community, and said in a statement:
<br><br>
“Israeli universities are complicit in these war crimes and genocidal acts against the Palestinian people. They form a central pillar of the apartheid system and the structure of settler colonialism, through their involvement in developing weapons systems, military doctrines, and legal justifications for the collective targeting of Palestinians.”
<br><br>
The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel issued a statement on 6 November, saying:
<br><br>
“We call on students, faculty and alumni to demand that their universities condemn the destruction of Gaza’s two main universities, naming Israel as the perpetrator, and call for an immediate ceasefire. We call on international university networks, including the International Association of Universities, the Mediterranean Universities Union, and the Association of Arab Universities, to mobilise their networks to call for an immediate ceasefire.”

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

                    <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
