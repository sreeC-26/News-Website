          <p>Two shipments of aid arrived in Gaza over the weekend – the first since Israel started bombing the Palestinian enclave in the wake of a deadly Hamas attack on October 7.
            The besieged enclave, home to 2.3 million people, has been in dire need of humanitarian aid after Israel cut off food, fuel and electricity supplies before launching a bombing campaign.
            
            <br>
            <br>
           
            More than 4,600 Palestinians, more than a third of them children, have been killed in the relentless bombardments. Israel says it’s targeting Hamas fighters who killed more than 1,400 people in the October 7 attack in southern Israel.

<li>Doctors from Gaza’s only cancer hospital have warned that they are running perilously low on fuel and could be forced to shut down.</li>
<li>Health services in Gaza have been stretched to their limits as Israel’s siege chokes off access to much-needed medical supplies and doctors work under the light of phones as fuel supplies run out.</li>

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
