          <p>Palestine is one of the most beautiful countries in the world, and sadly dew to the unstopping war that beauty can't be seen 
            this article its is impossible to describe years of destruction, so that is why we limited it down to what happened after the 7th of October. After the events of the 7th of October 
            millions died, lands were burnt to the ground, people ran and are still running  for their lives, kids lost their families and their childhood , a lot has happened to the holy land of Palestine.
        <br><br>
        
                Over the past month, the world’s attention has been almost exclusively focused on what is often described as the Israel-Hamas war.
        
                    More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army in the besieged Gaza Strip since October 7 by heavy aerial and artillery bombardments – more than 4,000 children and 2,550 women.<br><br>
        Some 24,800 others, including 10,000 children, have been injured, and 1.5 million people – some 60 percent of the population – have been forcibly displaced from their homes hoping to escape death, with many of them killed while sheltering in hospitals, schools and refugee camps.
        But aside from attacks on the Gaza Strip, Israel and Israeli settlers have simultaneously intensified attacks against Palestinians beyond the enclave. </P>

                <p>Under Israel’s 56-year military occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, Israeli forces have regularly opened fire at unarmed Palestinians during daily raids and confrontations.<br><br>
                    Matters on the ground were already tense in those areas well before October 7. In fact, the United Nations had declared 2022 the “deadliest” year for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2006. Israeli forces had killed 170 Palestinians in those areas in 2022, including more than 30 children, while more than 9,000 others were injured.
                               The number of Palestinians killed in 2023 has already significantly surpassed last year’s death toll.<br><br>
                   Since January 1, Israeli forces and settlers have killed at least 371 people in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Nearly half of those – 163 people – were killed just in the past month. At least 43 of them were children.
                   More than 2,300 others have been wounded over the past month, including at least 244 children, with more than half of them injured in protests against the bombardment of Gaza.

                        <p>Another main major development since October 7 is the sharp increase in the number of Palestinians arrested by Israeli forces. In two weeks, Israel had more than doubled the number of Palestinians in its custody.<br><br> Around 3,200 Palestinian labourers from Gaza who were arrested inside Israel early in the war were released by Israel last week.

                            Many of those who were already inside the prisons, or were newly detained, have been assaulted by Israeli forces, according to prisoner testimonies and rights groups. At least two prisoners lost their lives in Israeli custody shortly after they were arrested since October 7. A third, a Palestinian worker from Gaza who had cancer, was announced dead by Wafa news agency on Monday.
                            “The prisoners are undergoing the harshest beatings and torture in Israeli prisons at the moment,” Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, told bessan .
                            <br><br>
                            “More often than not, six or seven guards beat one prisoner all over his body, using sticks, handcuffs, their boots – whatever they have. Some of the prisoners have suffered broken bones and teeth as a result,” he said.
                           
                        <br><br>
                        “The arrest campaign is part of the Israeli aggression waged on the Palestinian people. These arrests are not specific to people who are suspected of being security threats. It is obvious that this is an act of revenge,” said Fares.
                        <br><br>
                        Several videos have also emerged in recent weeks of Israeli soldiers beating, stepping on, abusing and humiliating detained Palestinians who have been blindfolded, handcuffed, and stripped of their clothing, either partially or entirely. Many social media users said the scenes brought back memories of the torture by United States forces in Iraq’s Abu Ghraib prison in 2003.

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
