          <p>The UN report today, Wednesday, indicated that there are no active bakeries in northern Gaza due to shortages of fuel, water, and wheat flour, along with significant damages. The report from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated that food security partners haven't been able to provide assistance in the north over the past seven days.
            <br>
            <br>
            Israeli airstrikes continue near hospitals in Gaza, which accommodate tens of thousands of internally displaced people who only have access to basic services. The report highlighted that shelters in the southern region cannot accommodate new arrivals due to extreme overcrowding, forcing around 600 displaced individuals to share a single toilet.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, the United Nations mentioned that the daily volume of humanitarian aid entering from Egypt only meets a small portion of people's needs. Drinking water brought in only fulfills 4% of Gaza's population, while the crucially needed fuel remains prohibited. Gaza has been suffering a complete power outage since October 11th, following Israel's halt of electricity and fuel supplies, leading to the closure of the sole power plant in Gaza.
The Israeli occupation authorities still prohibit fuel entry into the region, urgently needed to operate power generators for life-saving equipment, as per the report.

           <p>As the war between Israel and Hamas enters its second month and with more than 10,000 people killed in Gaza, besieged civilians struggle to survive amidst ongoing power and water cuts. Palestinians who managed to escape the Israeli ground invasion in northern Gaza now face scarcity of food and medicine in the south. There's no apparent end in sight to the war ignited by Hamas' attack on the seventh of October.
            <br><br>
            Several hundred aid trucks have entered Gaza through the southern Rafah crossing since the start of the war. However, relief organizations state that this remains a drop in the ocean of need. Each day has become the start of a challenging cycle of searching for bread and water and waiting in queues.
            <br></p>

            <br>
            <p>
                The feeling of despair pervades the resilient Gaza community, which has endured decades of conflict, four wars with Israel, and a 16-year blockade since Hamas seized power from its Palestinian rival."There is a real threat of malnutrition, and people are suffering from severe hunger," she added, stating that what relief workers term "food insecurity" has become the new baseline for Gaza's population, totaling 2.3 million people.

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

                    <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
