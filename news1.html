        <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
            But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land?

                <P>
                    Palestine is a Middle Eastern nation-state covering 6,220 km2 of land across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank The population of the State of Palestine is estimated at 4.55 million people, with an average population density of 731 people per km2
                    the most populous city in Gaza City, with 750,000 residents\
                    The majority of the Palestinian population are Muslims (93%), mostly of the Sunni branch. There is also a significant minority of Christians (6%) and smaller minorities of Samaritans and Druze. Palestinian Arabic, a distinct dialect subgroup of Levantine Arabic, is the most widely spoken language in Palestine. The most common second language is English. In addition to its Palestinian population, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live in the Palestinian Territories, in contradiction of international law. This is a product of the ongoing Israeli military occupation of Palestine. 
                <br><br>
        
                In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly proposed a plan to divide Palestine into two states: Jewish and Arab. The Jews in Palestine at that time constituted a third of the population. The majority of them had come from Europe during the few years preceding this date, and they controlled an area amounting to less than 6% of the historic State of Palestine. However, the plan proposed by the United Nations allocated 55% of the area of the historic State of Palestine to them. The Palestinians and their Arab allies rejected the proposed plan. For its part, the Zionist movement agreed to the proposed plan, especially since it legitimized the idea of building a Jewish state on the Arab land of Palestine, but it did not agree to the proposed borders. Therefore, the Zionists launched intense campaigns to seize more of the lands of historic Palestine.

        <p>
            At the beginning of 1948, the Zionists took control of dozens of Palestinian cities and villages and expelled their Palestinian residents from their homes by force. All of this was done under the eyes of the British Mandate authorities present in the region. In most cases, the Zionists committed organized mass massacres against the Palestinian people. The Zionists' message was clear: either the Palestinians leave their lands, or we will kill them. The British decided to end their mandate for Palestine on May 14, 1948. As this date approached, the Zionists intensified their efforts to control as much of the Palestinian lands as possible. 
           <br><br>
            In April 1948, the Zionists took control of the city of Haifa, one of the largest Palestinian cities, and their next target was the city of Jaffa.
             On the same day that the British Mandate forces officially withdrew from Palestine, David Ben-Gurion, head of the Zionist Agency, announced the establishment of the State of Israel. The United Nations appointed Swedish diplomat Folke Bernadotte as its mediator in Palestine. Bernadotte recognized the tragedy of the Palestinian people and tried to find a solution to end their suffering caused by the Zionists. His tireless efforts to reach a peaceful solution to stop the ongoing Zionist ethnic cleansing campaigns against the Palestinians ended when the Zionists assassinated him in September 1948. The Nakba symbolizes the 1948 mass forced displacement of more than 750,000 Palestinians from their homes and lands in Palestine.

                <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
