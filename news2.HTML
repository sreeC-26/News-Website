          <p>Conflicts and wars lead to disasters and destruction everywhere they go. Due to these conflicts, the concept of war crimes has been developed particularly at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. War crimes formally known as  IHL are  International humanitarian law which states a set of international laws that set out what can and cannot be done during an armed conflict both governmental forces and non-state armed groups. 
            <br><br>
            The main rules are: You do not torture people. You do not attack civilians. you do not attack hospitals  You limit as much as you can the impact of your warfare on women and children. You treat detainees humanely. Bombing a hospital is a war crime that the Zionists committed many times during this war, one of the first hospitals boomed was The Arab National Hospital (Baptist).

        <p>The Arab National Hospital (Baptist) is a local institution that provides health care to residents of different areas of the Gaza
            Strip “Al-Baptist” is located in one of the residential squares in the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood in the Gaza Strip, and close to the 
            west is the Church of “Saint Philip the Evangelist.” They are separated by Umm Al-Laymoun Street, which connects Palestine Square to the 
            north and Askola Square to the south. It is one of the oldest hospitals in Gaza City and was established at the end of the 19th century AD.
        <br><br>
        It was the first of many hospitals that turned into massacres on October 17, 2023, due to the ongoing war between Palestine and Israel. 
             On October 17, 2023, Israel committed one of the most horrific massacres in the Gaza Strip, as its aircraft targeted the Arab National Hospital (Baptist), 
             leading to the martyrdom of more than 500 Palestinians, the majority of whom were women and children who took the hospital as a safe refuge from Israeli raids. 
        <br><br>
        The air strike resulted in the killing and wounding of hundreds of Palestinians, and the bodies of some martyrs were transformed into scattered body parts and 
             others were charred. In addition, a huge fire broke out in parts of the hospital, destroying a large part of it. This was not the first raid on 
             Al-Baptist Hospital during the Israeli aggression on Gaza, as occupation aircraft targeted it on October 15, 2023, which led to the injury of 4 of its 
             medical personnel, and the destruction of some of its departments.
        <br><br>
        Although what Israel did was considered a war crime they weren’t not punished for what they did which led to more and more massacres and more and more war crimes
        . Another famous massacre was al-Shifa Hospital.

    Al-Shifa Hospital, properly known as Dar al-Shifa Hospital, is the largest medical complex and central hospital in the Gaza Strip, 
    located in the neighborhood of northern Rimal in Gaza City in the Gaza Governorate. Last week, the Israeli army bombed an ambulance
     outside the hospital, part of a convoy that was meant to carry patients from Gaza City to the Rafah border crossing, so they could 
     be treated in Egypt.
<br><br>
Fifteen people were killed in the attack, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which had 
     coordinated the journey with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Gaza. Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the 
     attack, which killed people inside and around the ambulance, should be investigated as a possible war crime.
<br><br>
“We are minutes away from imminent death,” Muhammad Abu Salmiya, al-Shifa Hospital’s director, told Bessan news from inside the besieged facility on Saturday, where operations had to be suspended after it ran out of power and fuel.

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>

                    <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling. </p>
