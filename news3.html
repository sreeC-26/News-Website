        <br>
          <p>Since the start of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in late September 2000, Palestinian refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to racist attacks carried out by Israeli occupation forces. According to estimates by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency), approximately 250 refugee homes in Gaza were destroyed due to continuous Israeli shelling of the refugee camps until March 31, 2001. In the West Bank camps, UNRWA estimates that around 424 refugee families received emergency assistance from the agency to repair their damaged homes as a result of Israeli shelling.
            <br>
            <br>
            Recently, these Israeli attacks have taken on a new brutal character, evident in the latest Israeli assaults on Palestinian refugee camps. At the end of last April, Israeli occupation forces shelled Khan Younis Camp in the Gaza Strip in an operation they termed "Operation Fun Time," resulting in the destruction of about 30 homes and leaving around 50 families (approximately 500 people) homeless. Around 2 a.m. on May 2nd, Israeli tanks and bulldozers entered the Brazil refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip, demolishing several refugee homes. In both attacks, a significant number of refugees, including many children, were killed and injured.
            <br></p>

            <br>
           <p> These attacks orchestrated by the Sharon government represent an additional chapter in the series of crimes committed by Sharon against Palestinian refugees throughout his military and political career. This includes the assault on the Bureij camp in Gaza in 1953, resulting in the martyrdom of 43 camp residents, as well as the comprehensive destruction of refugee homes in Gaza in the early 1970s, leaving around 900 refugee families homeless. It extends to the horrific massacre of refugees in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut in 1982, claiming the lives of several thousand martyrs among the refugees and others.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, the United Nations must consider the recommendations raised by its Human Rights Committee through a fact-finding mission that visited the region and examined the ongoing situation. In its report submitted in March of this year, the fact-finding committee presented its recommendations clearly, particularly emphasizing the necessity of effective and appropriate international presence in the occupied Palestinian territories to monitor the implementation of human rights laws and submit regular reports. Furthermore, it stressed the importance of ensuring full protection of the rights of Palestinians in these areas.
            <br></p>

            <br>
            <p>
            Finally, countries signatory to the Fourth Geneva Convention must urgently convene to establish an international mechanism to protect Palestinians in the occupied territories, including refugees. They should take appropriate decisions and individual as well as collective actions to ensure Israel's compliance with its obligations under the framework of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

                    <p>At around 6:30 a.m. on 7 October 2023, Hamas announced the start of what it called "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within 20 minutes, it destroyed many lands and killed many people. it turned a beautiful land into a big massacre.
                        But what may be the reason, the main question here is why.         Why would a group of palatines attack? why would they kill and ruin precious pieces of land? </p>
